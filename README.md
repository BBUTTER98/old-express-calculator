# App Overview
It's simple app taking 2 inputs and performing any one of the 4 math operations and displaying result. It's my first application using ExpressJS.
# How to use
To use an application, first you need to download the repo, go to project directory, type command "npm i" to install all dependencies and in the same place type command "node index.js" to start server. Last step is typing in browser url "localhost:3000" and you can use an application.
